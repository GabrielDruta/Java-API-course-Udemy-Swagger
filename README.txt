Simple Java Spring API project based on a Udemy Course
It details setting up the development environment: JDK, SpringToolSuite, MySQL
creating the API and the controller paths, calls to the API 
support for XML or JSON, Exceptions, Pagination
JUnit 5 & Mockito Testing, and RestAssured
H2 in Memory Databases, Native QL queries & JPQL

And finally, the newest thing I have learned and the concept for which I have followed this course to the end,
 API documentation automation with Swagger

Couldn't get Spring Security and the JWTs to work, decided to continue the concept in a future project, ended up commenting all the classes related to Authorization or Security
